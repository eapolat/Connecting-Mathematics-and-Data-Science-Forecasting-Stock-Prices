# Connecting-Mathematics-and-Data-Science-Forecasting-Stock-Prices
A mathematical and data-driven analysis of stock forecasting models. This project explains the theoretical foundations (Stochastic Calculus &amp; Probability) of GBM, GARCH, and ARIMA while implementing modern LSTM networks. By applying these to real S&amp;P 500 data, it evaluates the bridge between math theory and ML performance.
